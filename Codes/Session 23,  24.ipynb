            "The Importance of Health and \n",
            "Health Care\n",
            "The American health care system is an engine for innovation that develops \n",
            "and broadly disseminates advanced, life-enhancing treatments and offers \n",
            "a wide set of choices for consumers of health care. The current health care system provides enormous benefits, but there are substantial opportunities for reforms that would reduce costs, increase access, enhance quality, and improve the health of Americans.\n",
            "An individual’s health can be maintained or improved in many ways, \n",
            "including through changes in personal behavior and through the appropriate \n",
            "consumption of health care services. While there is substantial health care spending in the United States, the importance of health does provide a strong rationale for this level of spending. But because health care financing and delivery are often inefficient, there are opportunities to advance health and access to health care services without further growth in spending. To improve the efficiency of health care financing and delivery, the Administration has pursued policies that would increase incentives for individuals to purchase consumer-directed health insurance plans. The Administration has also worked to link provider payments to performance, thus rewarding efficient delivery of health care. In the President’s State of the Union Address, he proposed changing the tax treatment of health insurance, offering all Americans a standard deduction for buying health insurance. Such a change could play an important role in increasing the efficiency of the American health care system and expanding health insurance coverage. \n",
            "The key points in this chapter are:\n",
            "• Health can be improved not only through the consumption of health \n",
            "care services, but also through individual behavior and lifestyle choices \n",
            "such as quitting smoking, eating more nutritious foods, and getting more exercise.\n",
            "• Health care has enhanced the health of our population; greater efficiency \n",
            "in the health care system, however, could yield even greater health for Americans without increasing health care spending.\n",
            "• Rapid growth in health care costs and limited access to health insurance \n",
            "continue to present challenges to the health care system.\n",
            "• Administration policies focus on reducing cost growth, improving \n",
            "quality, and expanding access to health insurance through an emphasis on private sector and market-based solutions. \n",

            "and services comes from direct consumption, the desire for health care is not derived directly from the consumption of the medical procedures themselves; rather, it comes from the direct value of improved health that is produced by health care. For example, demand for an MP3 player is based on the enjoyment that an MP3 player brings to a consumer, but few would choose to get a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the same reason. Rather, a consumer’s desire to have her gallbladder removed is directly related to the positive impact the operation is likely to have on her health. Understanding how health is produced, demanded, and valued is a useful starting point for evaluating the health care system and health care policy. \n",
            "Demand for Health\n",
            "People demand health because of its role in facilitating and providing \n",

A person derives value from the quality of life directly and indirectly: directly because one’s level of health affects the enjoyment of goods and leisure and indirectly because one’s level of health enhances productivity (Box 4-1). Enhanced productivity can be rewarded in the labor market through higher wages. The indirect effect of health on productivity suggests that health is an important component of human capital investment. Consistent with the basic principle of our economic system, consumers exercise choice in purchasing health care and other goods and services.\n",

            "Health care is only one of the factors that determine health. Other factors \n",
            "include individual behaviors, environmental factors, social factors, education, income, and genetics. If we think of an individual as a producer of health, the key production inputs are the time and money spent on health-improving activities and health care. Health-improving activities can include individual choices regarding exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle. Health care can include hospital care, outpatient visits to medical providers, nursing home care, and medication. Because health can deteriorate from accidents, sudden disease, and the effects of aging, health care inputs are needed not only to maintain current levels of health but also possibly to restore health following an illness or injury.\n",

National health care spending has grown more rapidly than the economy as a whole, so health care accounts for an increasing share of the overall economy (Chart 4-1).

            "because as income increases, a greater proportion of income is typically spent on health care. The aging of the population and increasing disease prevalence is a third important factor contributing to expenditure growth in the United States. Other cited factors include more rapid wage growth in the health sector, greater insurance coverage supported by large government subsidies through both government-sponsored programs and tax subsidies, and the low share of health expenses paid out-of-pocket by health consumers.\n",

            "because it has been reliably and consistently measured over time, it offers a unique historical view of trends in health. United States life expectancy trends since 1900 both from birth and from age 65 are shown in Chart 4-2. In the two panels of this chart, we see life expectancy gains throughout the century. Progress in life expectancy at birth was rapid in the first half of the century, growing from 48 to 68 years. Between 1950 and 1970, life expectancy at birth grew gradually, reaching only 71 by 1970. Progress picked up in the 1970s, with life expectancy reaching age 78 by 2004. There is a contrasting pattern for the life expectancy among those who live to age 65. Life expectancy at age \n",

Starting in the 1970s, the pace of improvement accelerated. By 2004, life expectancy at age 65 was 18.5 additional years; a gain of 3.5 years of life over the past 3.5 decades.\n",

            "Changes in the first half of the 20th century came largely through progress in reducing malnutrition, improving sanitation, and containing infection through improved public health measures and the use of antibiotic agents such as penicillin. After about 20 years of gradual improvement in life expectancy, the rising longevity from 1970 reflects progress in treating life-threatening ailments prevalent among those over 50. As shown in Table 4-1, the largest single contributor to increased longevity has been reduced mortality from heart disease (3.6 years); reduced mortality from strokes added another 1.3 years to life expectancy. Reduced mortality from those two conditions has thus added nearly 5 years to the life expectancy of Americans.\n",

Market-oriented policies must address potential market failures that are at the root of the challenges in the health care system.

If the symptoms are serious enough and would be relieved by the therapy, the consumer might be willing to pay more than $100 for the therapy. The consumer would thus purchase the therapy regardless of how much of the $100 cost was covered by insurance, and the purchase would not be overconsumption. If the customer had milder symptoms, however, insurance may induce overconsumption. Suppose, for example, that the consumer would only be willing to pay $25 to relieve the symptoms.

Because the marginal tax rate of this family is roughly 30 percent, the current tax exemption for the cost of this insurance policy provides a $3,000 tax break to the family. Another family with the same income and an employer-sponsored health insurance policy worth $20,000 currently receives a tax break of $6,000. One advantage of the proposed standard deduction is that it provides the same tax treatment to all types of health insurance plans.

The flat tax break provides a strong incentive to obtain health insurance coverage, and it would allow families to reap the tax benefits of health insurance policies with optimal cost-sharing features.

Although these regulations tend to reduce insurance premiums for high-risk individuals, they also increase premiums for lower risk individuals. Those premium increases can have the unintended consequence of encouraging people to wait until they have a health problem before enrolling. If such adverse selection reduces participation of healthier people, premiums will increase and the voluntary insurance market may cease to operate effectively.

Health insurance policies with lower premiums would be more readily available because health insurance policies would not be subject to costly State mandates and regulations. The Administration also supports Association Health Plans—plans that allow small groups to band together to purchase insurance subject to Federal rather than State regula-tions—because they would reduce adverse selection problems encountered by small employers, achieve economies of scale in negotiating lower rates with participating insurers, and allow for greater participation in a competitive choice system of health insurance plans.\n",
